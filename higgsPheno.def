# singularity run --containall --bind /my/out/dir/ higgsPheno.sif
#     the "--containall" flag prevents interactions with your system

#     this allows scripts in that directory to be accessed from the image
#     and results from the image to persist in the directory
#     It also allows the run script to call .bashrc
